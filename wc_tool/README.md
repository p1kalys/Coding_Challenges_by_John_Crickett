# wc-tool

This is a coding challenge from John Crickett's coding challenges blog. It's a script that functions the same as the wc tool in any Unix-based OS. It works for counting bytes, counting line numbers, counting words, or counting characters. You can do this through denoting -c, -l, -w, or -m in the CLI, respectively. How to run in depth is explicated below.


## Setting up

Run using Node.js. To install Node.js, go [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).


## How to run it

Locate yourself in the correct folder that you have stored the script and run:

` npm [desired command] test.txt  `

Replace [desired command] with either -c (count bytes) -l (count length of text), -w(count words), or -m(count characters).
